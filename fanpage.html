    <h3>History</h3>
    <p class="statement">
        The Doors were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray
        Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most controversial and
        influential rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because of Morrison's lyrics and voice along with his erratic stage
        persona, and the group was widely regarded as an important part of the era's counterculture.<a
